# Deep Reinforcement Learning Workbook
## Author: Robert Tjarko Lange | 2019

In this repository I (Robert Tjarko Lange) document my self-study of Deep Reinforcement Learning. More specifically, I collect reading notes as well as reproduction attempts. The chronology of this repository is based on the amazing "Spinning Up in DRL" tutorial by OpenAI.
